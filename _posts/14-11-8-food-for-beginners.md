In September last year (2014) I came across a startup with a bold vision for changing the world's food: Soylent. They promised a food that was nutritionally complete, cheap and very easy to prepare. In case you haven't heard about Soylent before, they're founded by a young, hungry Silicon Valleyite called _Rob Rhinehart_ who decided that it was about time food got a good optimising. He took the approach of any good engineer and came up with a list of requirements that the body needs through research and testing on himself. 

Soylent seemed to me to be a great idea. In Rob's words, it's the food equivalent of water: when you're thirsty you can turn on the tap and get a glass of a very cheap, very healthy drink. It may not blow your tastebuds out of the water (bad choice of metaphor), but that's not why you drank it. Soylent should be the same: it's for those times when you want a quick, healthy and cheap meal. Currently there's nothing on the market that ticks all three of those boxes at the same time, and this is the gap that Rob spotted. Have a look at their website at [soylent.me](http://soylent.me) for more info.

## Ordering

I was sold, so I ordered some in the very first wave of backers. Others apparently agreed, and the orders soared way over their target. However, the company was hit by a series of delays and then, almost a year after the product was meant to be delivered, all orders to international customers were cancelled. Although this was obviously a massive disappointment, this blog is not intended to be a complaint: I'm still very much on board with what Soylent are trying to achieve and I very much hope that they get things sorted later on. In the meantime though, I went down the rabbit-hole of DIY soylent (little 's') and I'm documenting my experiences here in case others in my situation are thinking about it.

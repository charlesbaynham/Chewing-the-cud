Our boxes turned up pretty quickly. Amazon and Bulk powders gave me free delivery so we ended up waiting for the Potassium supplement to come from eBay. You can get it elsewhere, but I found a seller on eBay that was far cheaper and, from the photos, was offering exactly the same product. As it happens Potassium ends up being disproportionally expensive compared to the rest of the ingredients, so finding it slightly cheaper was a bonus. (By "expensive" I mean 50p per day rather than 3p)

I had them delivered to work, which was a foolish mistake since I cycle: there really is a lot. Here's a photo of all the assembled bits and pieces after I'd carted them home.

So that's what I'm eating for the next 30 days. Yum. 

Now for the mixing, and I quickly encountered a problem: I just don't have a bowl big enough for more than a day's worth of soylent. When planning this, I hadn't appreciated quite how large the portions would be. I guess I'd unconsciously subscribed to the idea of soylent as a futuristic magic pill that eliminates your hunger. Not so: a day's worth filled my blender to the brim - 1.5L with water added. So I mixed up a day's portion and planned to buy a bigger container to do the mixing next time. If you've got a old protein shake box lying around then that'd be perfect, but I didn't. 

## First impressions

So here is it! The point at which I find out whether I've signed myself up for a month of grim tasting goop or nourishing milkshake.

That's actually pretty nice! The flavour comes from the whey protein and I went for vanilla. It's very sweet, so maybe next time I'll go for plain and flavour it myself. It was, however, like drinking the foam on top of a beer. Fair enough, you're not supposed to drink it straight out of the blender. I left it to chill overnight and hopefully settle a bit. (A fridge would be ideal obviously but I live on a house-boat and don't have one. Fortunately I'm British, and lucky enough to live in a natural fridge, so no problem.)

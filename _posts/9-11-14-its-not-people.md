There's actually a large community of Soylent DIYers. The official forum is abuzz with them and there's a page where you can submit your own recipe and compare it to others', complete with handy cost-per-day and RDA % targets calculators. Many of these are based in the US and rely on ingredients that we don't really have so much in Europe (I'm in the UK) like Masa. 

Amongst UK DIYers the most popular recipe is called "Liquid Cake." It's gone through a few revisions and seems to have a fairly balanced profile: everything is at or around 100% except for carbohydrates which is intentional. As the author explains, this is a high-protein, low-carbs diet - good for weight loss. It gets its bulk from Whey protein, Scottish oats and Rapeseed oil (which is the same thing as Canola oil it turns out). The rest of the ingredients all are designed to top your RDA numbers up to 100% in categories like fibre and vitamins. 

There was one ingredient that stood out: Choline. After a bit of Googling, I found out that Choline is a precursor to Acetylcholine, a key neurotransmitter. You get Choline naturally from in your diet. The highest common(ish) sources are liver and eggs but it's found in smaller amounts in all sorts of things. Interestingly, 90% of the population does not get enough Choline and deficiency symptoms include lack of concentration and tiredness. Could this be the magic bullet? Since I have little-to-no experience in Biology, I'm going to say yes. Definitely. 

## Tuning

This looked good, but I did want to make some changes. For example, I don't really want to lose weight so I'd like to add back in some of those missing carbs. Malodextrin seems to be the way to do this: it's a carb that's got a pretty bad press because it just dumps empty calories into your system. However, that's exactly what I wanted, so in it went. 

The DIY soylent site has a useful profile tool where you can select/calculate your needs based on a few simple questions. The answer comes from the regulatory body of your choice, be that the US FDA, the UK government guidelines or Rob Rhinehart's conclusions. I picked a profile for an adult male, 20-35, mild exercise and got a list of numbers. Since I'd copied the Liquid Cake recipe, most of these numbers were already near 100%. I added in Malodextrin, entered in calories, carbs, protein and fat per gram and tweaked it up until I hit my daily calorie target. 

This still left me well shy of 100% on carbs, but this is made up for by the extra protein. If you're going to go for the recommended carbs-protein-fat ratio then you might want to chuck the Malodextrin in favour of something else: it's good as a calorie filler but not for much else. Here's my final recipe:

At this point I finally managed to persuade my long suffering girlfriend to get involved. She wanted a slightly different profile, tuned more towards weight-loss and obviously targeted at females, so we came up with one for her that scrapped the Malodextrin and had reduced oil & protein. Hers is here:

## Ordering

Finally, time to get the credit card out. We went for enough to make around 14 days (for two people, so 28 really) though I found that a lot of the ingredients weren't worth buying unless you got them in pots big enough to last much longer than that. Still, even though I ended up getting more than I needed, total cost came in at about £150. Not bad really considering that works out to £5.30 per day each. Now to wait.

After the first batch, I realised that I was a little understocked on equipment. I had a decent blender which was very necessary, but my scales were a bit rubbish and I had no mixing bowl big enough. We decided that it'd be good to mix it into daily batches for convenience. In the end, we settled on the following list:

* Blender
* Big mixing bowl (I bought a bucket that I've designated soylent only)
* Accurate scales. Digital is better
* Food bags big enough for a day's worth
* Syringe to measure the oil. ([WolframAlpha helpfully tells me](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=volume+of+1g+canola+oil) that 1g of oil = 1.1ml)

I've also bought a coffee grinder so that I can grind up the vitamin pills lest I forget to take them separately. It hasn't arrived yet but I'll let you know how it goes.

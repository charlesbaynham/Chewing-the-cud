So up I woke, early but not so bright, looking forward to my first proper taste of the future. Breakfast is the meal that I think would be most improved by soylent. It's a meal that I often skip and the few times that I don't it's just a piece of toast or a pastry. Having a perfectly balanced drink to start the day off with would be ideal. 

The soylent had definitely firmed up overnight, and also become more runny. Last night it had the consistency of bubbly heavy cream, now it was looking more like a drink. The taste was fine: nothing inspiring but then that's not the point. There was a bit of grittiness left over but it wasn't unpleasant. It certainly filled me up though: suddenly the idea of this replacing my food became far less far-fetched. 

Fed and ready to go in less than 5 minutes, I took a bottle with me to have for lunch later. 

I've heard from the official Soylent forums and press-releases that suddenly going from no Soylent to 100% Soylent can make one a bit windy, so I planned to ease myself in over the next week or so. I'm sorry to admit though that I didn't have any more the first day: a friend had invited us for dinner that night and at lunch I was too shy to whip out my techo-gloop in a room full of people I'd just met and would be working with for the next few years.
